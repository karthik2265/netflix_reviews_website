                      This is one of those movies that definitely won’t be for everyone but I enjoyed it myself. It’s got an incredible true story to it and the script is better than I expected. It’s fast paced with some really funny scenes. Wahlberg
                      is pretty funny in this and with The Rock and Anthony Mackie as well they all make a great team.

                      There is something about this movie, I don't know what it is or why I love it but i just do. Me and my friends all have a similar taste in movies, but yet they all don't like this movie. I write this review on my 5th time
                      watching it. Maybe it's because i love this era 90's Miami. Maybe its cause i'm a huge fan of all three main characters. Maybe it's because I love the story. i have no idea. but I have never recommended a movie more than this
                      one right here. Please go watch

                      One of the best psychological thrillers to ever have been written and made, Gone Girl, now available on Netflix, is an experience that everyone should go through. If you haven't already gotten all the massive spoilers for this
                      twisted movie, you're in for a headspinning ride. Even if you have, the dark, deranged and horrifyingly correct minds of the characters will be enough to make you unsettled and uncomfortable.

                      As with all the other David Fincher movies, it can be categorized as MIND-BLOWING. Every second of it consists of happenings, and my mind did not get a chance to settle. It's like I was on a roller coaster that never waited for
                      me to regain my powers. In fact, the movie does not sit back and even surprises you until the last seconds and makes you try to figure out a new puzzle! (Though I guess the mess is colossal, it cannot be cleaned up!)

                      Having played a couple of the MH games; I’ve watched almost every video game adaption ever; and I’m familiar with the cast, I can say without a doubt this movie is...just plain average. Here’s breakdown of a few things on why
                      it’s not the best or worst video game adaptation:

                      At first glance, it sounded like a very good movie with tons of action and great movements. But when I decided to look through the reviews, everybody was saying how bad it was. But still, I gave the movie a chance. I was very
                      scared to see if it was a bad movie, but instead, the movie really gave me a good time. The editing was super good and the scenes moved along quite well which I could understand. The only reason I am making this a three-star is
                      that the plot was not as much good as I thought it to be. Truly horrible moments there could be! I couldn't keep standing to see those annoying fight scenes between the Hunter and the main character.

                      Both Warner Bros. and us viewers seem to be on a roll. They already delivered the year's one of the most awaited (and longest) action blockbusters with Zack Snyder's Justice League, and have now delivered another eye-popping,
                      heart-stopping, jaw-dropping action blockbuster, Godzilla vs. Kong. It's no spoiler that the film centers on the epic clash between the two eponymous giant creatures, and the result is a massively entertaining film which reminds
                      us why cinema going used to be such a pleasant experience in the pre-COVID times

                      The plot is very smoothy and predictable.Yet,the visual experience is a treat.Both Godzilla and Kong together rocked the show with equal screen space,but the story morely focused on Kong.The CGI was great and improved than the
                      Godzilla (2014).More visualised and colourful effects made on CGI made it a worthy watchable.The action scenes were awesome and stylish which are the only saving grace in the film.The character arks are still decent and this
                      movie give us characters we might care.

                      The cult classic has returned, as followers of the franchise had enough hints dropped at the end of the first installment to indicate "The Blind Man" was going to return and this time seek his wrath on another group of
                      'victims'.

                      Just saw the movie in theaters and it was most definitely worth it if you enjoy thriller movies! The actors were great, the whole production of the movie was amazing and definitely worth watching. It has some unexpected turns at
                      points where you would think one thing, but it would turn out to be something completely different which I loved about it. There was not one time where I wasn’t intrigued to see what was going to happen next, and not one boring
                      moment. 10/10 would definitely recommend! (I would also recommend watching at a movie theater for a better experience!)
